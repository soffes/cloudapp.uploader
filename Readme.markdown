# CloudApp.uploader

This is the [CloudApp](http://getcloudapp.com) `RMUploadKit` Plugin built for [Courier](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/courier/).

## Building

You'll need a 64-bit Mac running Snow Leopard to build CloudApp.uploader.  [ASIHTTPRequest](http://github.com/pokeb/asi-http-request) is the only dependency. To get it, just run the following command:

    $ git submodule update --init

You should be good to go after that.
